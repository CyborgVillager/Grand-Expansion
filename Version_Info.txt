 --v2 Tidying Up: Tidying up the code at the moment, before get to modifying it. I'm pretty stoked about this, my excitment
                    on seeing this mini program grow is gonna be a blast!!.

                    Besides that the main objectives is to clean up the code:
                     line 993-1074 @ Main.py requires work on readability
                      -line 300 @ Menu.py -> speed to gather resources
                        Once the program gets a bit more finalize will be increasing the time it takes to gather resource
                        this will also includes for a number of factors that will contribute to the speed as well.
